# Fake_News_Detection

This repository contains Jupyter notebook with a machine learning project that aims to detect fake news articles from real news articles. The project was built during an NLP Internship and uses a variety of natural language processing techniques and algorithms to classify news articles as either real or fake.

The dataset used for this assignment comes from https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset. 

The notebook begins with Importing libraries, followed by exploring the data and creating additional features and using histograms to visualize the data.  

Some linguistic features created for the data include:<br>
character count<br>
word count<br>
word density: character count / word count<br>
punctuation count<br>
title word count: number of words starting with a uppercase letter followed by all lowercase<br>
upper case word count: count of all words that are in all uppercase<br>
noun count<br>
pronoun count<br>
<br>

The notebook then concludes with Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models that classify the text as either Real or Fake.
