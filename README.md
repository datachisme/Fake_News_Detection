# Fake_News_Detection

This repository contains Jupyter notebook with a machine learning project that aims to detect fake news articles from real news articles. The project was built during an NLP Internship and uses a variety of natural language processing techniques and algorithms to classify news articles as either real or fake.

The dataset used for this assignment comes from https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset. 

The notebook begins with Importing libraries, followed by exploring the data and creating additional features and using histograms to visualize the data.  

Some linguistic features created for the data include:
character count
word count
word density: character count / word count
punctuation count
title word count: number of words starting with a uppercase letter followed by all lowercase
upper case word count: count of all words that are in all uppercase
noun count
pronoun count

The notebook then concludes with Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models that classify the text as either Real or Fake.


We hope you find this project informative and useful. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback.
